ELOGIC PMS(Project Management System) revolves around tickets - tickets are grouped together as milestones, and milestones are scheduled for a project. As work is performed on your projects, tracking time is as simple as adding it to the ticket.  ELOGIC PMS(Project Management System) offers easy to use "Start Timer" and "Stop Timer" buttons when viewing a ticket and a cool alert bar along the top of the ELOGIC PMS(Project Management System) site so you can always see how much time you've spent on a task.

In addition, each project belongs to a client, meaning you can quickly find all work performed for a particular client.
